# Rocket Pool on DAppNode

This an **unofficial** [Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/) package for [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/). The goal of this project is to combine the power of Rocket Pool with the ease of DAppNode. An end user should be able to install this package in the typical way and start staking test ETH relatively painlessly.

Right now this project doesn't do any of that. It's just a hello world package. But my hope is that this won't be outlandishly difficult, since Rocket Pool is already a stack of Docker images, and DAppNode eats Docker images without complaint.
